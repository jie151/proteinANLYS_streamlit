<h2>Maps between Entrez Gene IDs and Gene Ontology (GO) IDs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>org.Hs.egGO is an R object that provides mappings between
entrez gene identifiers and the GO identifiers that they are 
directly associated with. This mapping and its reverse mapping do NOT
associate the child terms from the GO ontology with the gene.  Only
the directly evidenced terms are represented here.
</p>
<p>org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS is an R object that provides mappings between
a given GO identifier and all of the Entrez Gene identifiers annotated
at that GO term OR TO ONE OF IT'S CHILD NODES in the GO ontology.
Thus, this mapping is much larger and more inclusive than
org.Hs.egGO2EG.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If org.Hs.egGO is cast as a list, each Entrez Gene identifier is
mapped to a list of lists.  The names on the outer list are GO
identifiers.  Each inner list consists of three named elements: GOID,
Ontology, and Evidence.
</p>
<p>The GOID element matches the GO identifier named in the outer list and
is included for convenience when processing the data using 'lapply'.
</p>
<p>The Ontology element indicates which of the three Gene Ontology
categories this identifier belongs to.  The categories are biological
process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF).
</p>
<p>The Evidence element contains a code indicating what kind of evidence
supports the association of the GO identifier to the Entrez Gene
id. Some of the evidence codes in use include:
</p>
<p>IMP: inferred from mutant phenotype  
</p>
<p>IGI: inferred from genetic interaction
</p>
<p>IPI: inferred from physical interaction  
</p>
<p>ISS: inferred from sequence similarity 
</p>
<p>IDA: inferred from direct assay  
</p>
<p>IEP: inferred from expression pattern  
</p>
<p>IEA: inferred from electronic annotation  
</p>
<p>TAS: traceable author statement  
</p>
<p>NAS: non-traceable author statement  
</p>
<p>ND: no biological data available  
</p>
<p>IC: inferred by curator
</p>
<p>A more complete listing of evidence codes can be found at:
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml">http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml</a>
</p>
<p>If org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS or org.Hs.egGO2EG is cast as a list,
each GO term maps to a named vector of entrez gene identifiers and
evidence codes. A GO identifier may be mapped to the same entrez gene
identifier more than once but the evidence code can be
different. Mappings between Gene Ontology identifiers and Gene
Ontology terms and other information are available in a separate data
package named GO.
</p>
<p>Whenever any of these mappings are cast as a data.frame, all the
results will be output in an appropriate tabular form.
</p>
<p>Mappings between entrez gene identifiers and GO information were
obtained through their mappings to Entrez Gene identifiers. NAs are
assigned to entrez gene identifiers that can not be mapped to any Gene
Ontology information. Mappings between Gene Ontology identifiers an
Gene Ontology terms and other information are available in a separate
data package named GO.
</p>
<p>All mappings were based on data provided by: Gene Ontology  
http://current.geneontology.org/ontology/go-basic.obo  
With a date stamp from the source of: 2021-09-01
</p>
<p>For GO2ALL style mappings, the intention is to return all the genes
that are the same kind of term as the parent term (based on the idea
that they are more specific descriptions of the general term).
However because of this intent, not all relationship types will be
counted as offspring for this mapping.  Only &quot;is a&quot; and &quot;has a&quot; style
relationships indicate that the genes from the child terms would be
the same kind of thing.

## select() interface:
## Objects in this package can be accessed using the select() interface
## from the AnnotationDbi package. See ?select for details.

## Bimap interface:
x &lt;- org.Hs.egGO
# Get the entrez gene identifiers that are mapped to a GO ID
mapped_genes &lt;- mappedkeys(x)
# Convert to a list
xx &lt;- as.list(x[mapped_genes])
if(length(xx) &gt; 0) {
    # Try the first one
    got &lt;- xx[[1]]           
    got[[1]][["GOID"]]
    got[[1]][["Ontology"]]
    got[[1]][["Evidence"]]
}
# For the reverse map:
# Convert to a list
xx &lt;- as.list(org.Hs.egGO2EG)
if(length(xx) &gt; 0){
    # Gets the entrez gene ids for the top 2nd and 3nd GO identifiers
    goids &lt;- xx[2:3]
    # Gets the entrez gene ids for the first element of goids
    goids[[1]]
    # Evidence code for the mappings
    names(goids[[1]])
}
# For org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS
xx &lt;- as.list(org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS)
if(length(xx) &gt; 0){
    # Gets the Entrez Gene identifiers for the top 2nd and 3nd GO identifiers
