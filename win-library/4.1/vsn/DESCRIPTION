Description: The package implements a method for normalising microarray intensities from single- and 
        multiple-color arrays. It can also be used
	for data from other technologies, as long as they have similar format. The method uses a
	robust variant of the maximum-likelihood estimator for an additive-multiplicative error
	model and affine calibration. The model incorporates data calibration step (a.k.a.
	normalization), a model for the dependence of the variance on the mean intensity and a
        variance stabilizing data transformation. Differences between
        transformed intensities are analogous to "normalized
        log-ratios". However, in contrast to the latter, their
        variance is independent of the mean, and they are usually more
        sensitive and specific in detecting differential
        transcription.
